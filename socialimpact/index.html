    <h1>Social Impact Therory</h1>
    <p>
        This demo depicts a simplistic model of agents' sentiment change based on the state of
        their immediate neighbors. The <a fred="https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&q=social+impact+theory&btnG=&as_sdt=1%2C11&as_sdtp=">Social Impact Theory</a>
        was first introduced by social psycologist
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bibb_LatanÃ©">Bibb Latan&eacute;</a>.

    <h4>What you see ...</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>The graphics shows 2,500 agents aligned on
            a grid with periodic boundary conditions (i.e. on a torus).</li>
        <li>Each agent is in one of two states (red or blue) at any given time.</li>
        <li>The pobability to swicth states depends on the number
            of immediate neighbors in the opposite state.</li>
        <li>Agents are more likelky to <b>follow the majority</b> sentiment.</li>
        <li>The color saturation indicates the diversity of the neighbors' states.
            Hereby, saturated colors mean "all agree", faded "all disagree".</li>
        <!-- <li></li> -->

    <h4>How to ...</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Click on the graphic to <b>start</b> the simulation.</li>
        <li>Click again to <b>pause</b>.</li>
        <li>Press any key (while the graphic is on focus) to <b>reset</b> the initial population.</li>
